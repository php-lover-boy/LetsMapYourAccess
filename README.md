# LetsMapYourAccess (LeMYA)
The main idea of this system is related to the following presentation:
https://github.com/varchashva/LetsMapYourNetwork/blob/master/docs/LetsMapYourNetwork_BlackHat.pdf


One of the basic problems for managers of organizations is not having the right attitude and vision towards access to the organization's resources.

In other words, the managers of an organization do not have a correct understanding of the map of users' access to resources.
Experts in the network sector provide access for other users over time, but after a period of time, users' access to the organization's resources becomes very complicated.

The LeMYA system provides a graphical dashboard of user's access to the organization's resources.
It should be noted that this system has the ability to edit accesses manually (only authorized by the system administrator and record the log to change accesses manually) and automatically (import firewall ACL list).
Now LeMYA supports Fortinet firewall ACL list import. i should add another firewall support as soon as possible. 

In this system, different access levels are defined and users can have a detailed graphical view of users' access to resources according to their role.
